Branches created from latest `origin/main@ac0d42080`:

- dev: `user/DinahK-2SO/completed-turn-selection-scroll` -> `Dinah`
- publish: `user/DinahK-2SO/completed-turn-selection-scroll-publish` -> `origin`

Publish scope excludes this `AGENTS.md` handoff and local screenshots/reports.

### Commit and worktree discipline

- Publishable changes are committed first on dev as one self-contained commit:
  product code, product/Rust tests, tests that live naturally in the existing
  ItE2E framework, their deterministic fixtures, and release-checklist/ItE2E
  metadata.
- Dev-only changes are committed separately afterward: this `AGENTS.md`
  handoff, progress notes, ignored screenshots/reports/logs, local-only test
  orchestration, and experiments that do not belong to an existing framework.
- The publish worktree must directly cherry-pick the dev publishable commit. Do
  not cherry-pick a mixed commit and then restore dev-only files.
- Current publishable commit: `0a7c9355bdef7f70663820c79a60cfdc8c534678`.
- The separate `Start-Terminal` two-window startup-ordering fix is not part of
  this publishable commit or this issue branch.

## Current Stage

[2026-08-14] Step 3 - deterministic E2E and Rust GREEN; branch publication pending

### User-visible contract

- With an empty input and completed turns present, Tab moves focus from the
  input to the newest completed turn.
- Up/Down moves that focus through completed turns.
- Every focused completed turn must remain inside the visible chat viewport.
- Moving to an already-visible turn must not jump the viewport unnecessarily.
- Enter expansion, Esc dismissal, manual wheel scrolling, prompt-history
  Up/Down, replies, markers, and input rendering must remain unchanged.

### Current ownership hypothesis

```text
Tab / Up / Down
  -> app_keys.rs
  -> TabSession::select_older_completed_turn / select_newer_completed_turn
  -> selected_completed_turn_idx changes

chat viewport
  -> ui/chat.rs::render
  -> chat_scroll.offset
  -> Paragraph::scroll
```

The local hypothesis is that completed-turn selection mutates only
`selected_completed_turn_idx`; no code updates `chat_scroll.offset`, so keyboard
focus can move outside the viewport while rendering stays at the old offset.

### E2E reproduction steps

Use the existing `ItE2E` framework, deployed Dev package, and the deterministic
`Mock-AcpChatAgent.ps1` fixture:

1. Start Intelligent Terminal with `custom:chat-fixture` and open its Agent
  Pane.
2. Submit 12 uniquely named `SCROLL_TURN_nn_<guid>` prompts. For every prompt,
  wait for the fixture's unique `ACK_<prompt>` reply and for the connected input
  placeholder before sending the next one.
3. Assert the fixture log contains exactly 12 prompt records so the setup cannot
  pass when submissions were dropped or overwritten.
4. Capture the pane and prove the oldest prompt is outside the viewport while
  the newest prompt is visible.
5. Press Tab once to select the newest completed turn.
6. Press Up 11 times until the oldest completed turn is selected.
7. Capture the pane again.
8. RED oracle: the oldest unique prompt should now be visible because the
   viewport followed keyboard focus. The current bug is reproduced only if the
   focused prompt remains absent.
9. Save before/after screenshots, pane captures, and the fixture log as ignored
  local evidence.

The test must use unique prompt markers and prove the target starts off-screen;
otherwise visibility after navigation is not evidence of auto-scroll.

RED evidence is now valid: all 12 fixture prompts completed exactly once, the
newest turn was visible and the oldest was off-screen before navigation, and
the oldest remained absent after `Tab` plus 11 `Up` keys. Before/after captures
were unchanged at the visibility oracle.

### Implementation

- Completed-turn selection methods set a one-shot
  `completed_turn_selection_visible_pending` flag.
- The chat render pass consumes that flag before lazy history construction.
- Using the same pending-message, message, and completed-turn line builders as
  normal rendering, it computes the selected block's rendered row interval
  measured from the bottom.
- Scroll offset changes only when that interval falls outside the viewport.
  Selection of an already-visible turn is a no-op, and later manual scrolling
  is not overridden because the pending flag has already been consumed.

### TDD and validation evidence

- Live E2E RED: `Keyboard selection keeps focused completed turns visible`
  failed only at the final oldest-turn visibility oracle after all 12
  deterministic turns completed.
- Rust RED: `render_chat_keeps_keyboard_selected_completed_turn_visible`
  selected index 0 but rendered only turns 08-11.
- The same Rust test is GREEN and covers Tab on an already-visible newest turn,
  Up navigation to the oldest turn, Down navigation back to newest, and later
  manual-scroll preservation.
- Neighboring selection routing test and all `ui::chat::tests` passed (`36/36`).
- Full WTA suite: `1504 passed, 0 failed`.
- Explicit `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` WTA build succeeded with existing warnings
  only.
- Final Cargo and deployed Dev-package `wta.exe` SHA-256 both matched
  `E418EF6AE2AB1A51DD575EA57055BB46238A9A4BD5E11590053CD8F2B71C6BCD`.
- Final packaged E2E: `1 passed, 0 failed`.
- Release checklist item `C263` is `[x]` in the generated report.
- Visual inspection: before navigation only turns 09-11 are visible; after
  navigation turns 00-02 are visible and turn 00 has cyan keyboard focus. The
  pane is nonblank and prompt/reply/input rows do not overlap.

Local ignored evidence:

- `test/e2e/artifacts/completed-turn-selection-scroll/before-navigation.png`
- `test/e2e/artifacts/completed-turn-selection-scroll/after-navigation.png`
- `test/e2e/artifacts/completed-turn-selection-scroll/before-navigation.txt`
- `test/e2e/artifacts/completed-turn-selection-scroll/after-navigation.txt`
- `test/e2e/artifacts/completed-turn-selection-scroll/fixture.log`
- `test/e2e/artifacts/completed-turn-selection-scroll/final/report.html`
- `test/e2e/artifacts/completed-turn-selection-scroll/final/results.xml`

### Strict TDD workflow

1. Add the smallest live E2E case to the existing natural suite.
2. Deploy latest-main WTA before the RED run so the baseline binary is exact.
3. Run only the new case and confirm it fails at the visibility oracle for the
   expected reason. If it cannot reproduce, stop and report the evidence before
   changing product code.
4. Add a focused Rust state/render regression that captures the missing
   selection-to-scroll behavior and confirm RED.
5. Apply the smallest implementation at the owning scroll boundary.
6. Rerun the same focused Rust and live E2E checks for GREEN.
7. Run related chat tests, the full WTA suite, and explicit x64 WTA build.
8. Hot-refresh the exact built `wta.exe` into the Dev package, verify SHA-256,
   and rerun the full related E2E suite.
9. Inspect screenshots for a visible nonblank pane, selected target visibility,
   stable input layout, and no overlap.
10. Commit product/tests/existing-framework E2E/checklist metadata as the dev
  publishable commit; commit this handoff and local-only material separately.
11. Push dev and confirm remote synchronization, then directly cherry-pick the
  publishable commit into the publish worktree.

### Guardrails

- Do not make Up/Down scroll completed turns while input history owns focus.
- Do not infer visibility from selection index alone; the live viewport is the
  user-visible contract.
- Do not reset manual scroll globally on every selection key. Adjust only enough
  to reveal the selected turn.
- Height calculations must use the same rendered-line builders as the UI.
- Format only touched Rust files; crate-wide formatting causes unrelated churn.

### Separate E2E harness follow-up

Repeated investigation runs exposed an unrelated `Start-Terminal` race: COM
probing can begin before AUMID activation creates its first HWND, producing two
top-level windows in one process. Waiting for the first HWND before COM probing
changed controlled launches from `2 HWND / 2 logical windows` to `1 / 1`.

Do not include that harness change in this issue branch or publish PR. After the
auto-scroll fix PR is created, open a separate small branch/PR for the startup
ordering fix and its focused single-window regression coverage.

# Intelligent Terminal (Windows Terminal Fork)

AI-native Windows Terminal — agents (Copilot, Claude, Gemini, custom) can understand, fix, and automate terminal workflows.

## Core Components

- **WTA** (Windows Terminal Agent) — orchestrator binary. Launches agents, passes Terminal Protocol connection info. Agents control WT via `wtcli`.
  - Launch: `wta delegate --agent <agent> --delegate-agent <delegate> --cwd <cwd> "<prompt>"`
- **WT Protocol** (`IProtocolServer`) — sole integration surface. WinRT IDL + COM out-of-process server (MBM marshaling, MTA thread). Discovery via `WT_COM_CLSID` env var.
  - IDL: `src/cascadia/TerminalProtocol/TerminalProtocol.idl`
  - Server: `src/cascadia/WindowsTerminal/TerminalProtocolComServer.cpp`
- **WTCLI** — CLI client consuming `IProtocolServer` via `CoCreateInstance(CLSCTX_LOCAL_SERVER)`. Agents shell out to `wtcli list-panes`, `wtcli capture-pane`, etc.
- **ACP** (Agent Control Protocol) — JSON-RPC 2.0 spoken inside the helper+master architecture. `wta-helper` ↔ `wta-master` over a named pipe; `wta-master` ↔ agent CLI subprocess over stdio. The C++ side no longer participates in ACP directly — agent panes are plain `ConptyConnection`s hosting a `wta-helper` child. See `doc/specs/Multi-window-agent-pane.md`.

## UX

| Trigger | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| `>Toggle AI assistant` | Opens/toggles agent pane (`openAgentPane` action) |
| `?<prompt>` | Delegates to hidden background WTA process |
| `?` (empty) | No-op |
| `&` | Background task mode (future, C9) |

Agent pane: position configurable (`bottom`/`right`/`top`/`left`). Color-coded VT output.

## Settings (`settings.json`)

```jsonc

    "acpAgent": "copilot",           // "copilot", "gemini", or "custom:<cmd>"
    "acpModel": "",                  // Model override

    "aiIntegration.confirmation.inputOperations": "auto",
}
```

## Architecture

```
WindowEmperor (one WT process, N AppHosts/windows)
  |-- TerminalProtocolComServer (COM, MTA thread, WT_COM_CLSID)
  |-- SharedWta (singleton) -- spawns --> wta-master ──► agent CLI (ACP/stdio)
  |                                          ▲
  |                                          │ ACP/JSON-RPC over named pipe
  +-- AppHost[] → TerminalWindow → TerminalPage
        |-- CommandPalette (? / & prefixes)
        |-- Per-tab agent pane: ConptyConnection ───► wta-helper (conpty child)
        |                                            (one helper per tab, pre-warmed)
        +-- Protocol bridge (TerminalPage.Protocol.cpp)

External: Agent → wtcli → COM (IProtocolServer) → TerminalProtocolComServer → WindowEmperor
```

**Per-tab + per-window routing.** Each agent pane has its own helper bound
to an `owner_tab_id` (= WT tab StableId) and a `window_id`. All inbound
events that mutate per-tab state (`set_agent_state`, `tab_changed`,
`tab_closed`, `tab_renamed`) carry both ids; helpers filter by `window_id`
and (for `tab_changed`) by owner-lock in `switch_tab_session`. Outbound
helper events (`agent_state_changed`, `agent_status`, `autofix_state`,
`close_agent_pane`) carry `tab_id` so C++ can route via
`_FindTabByStableId` instead of fanning out across every pane / window.
See `doc/specs/Multi-window-agent-pane.md` §7.

**Helper is pre-warmed per tab.** Every new tab spawns a stashed agent
pane on creation (`_InitializeTab` → `_AutoCreateHiddenAgentPaneShared`
with `autoStash=true`, `--start-stashed`), so the helper is running and
its ACP session connects in the background from the start — even if the
user never opens the pane. This is what lets autofix work on a tab the
user hasn't interacted with. The agent CLI itself is spawned once by
`wta-master` at startup and shared across all helpers (each helper's
`initialize` is a cached replay; only `session/new` round-trips to the
CLI). `--start-stashed` only seeds `pane_open=false`; it does not defer
the handshake. The pre-warm is skipped when wta is unavailable, GPO
blocks all agents, or the tab arrived with an agent pane via cross-window
drag-in (`agentLeavesSeen > 0`). See `TabManagement.cpp:366`.

**Agent pane toggle = stash, not destroy.** `Ctrl+Shift+.` /
`Ctrl+Shift+/` / the bottom-bar button toggle via
`Tab::StashAgentPane`/`RestoreStashedAgentPane` (built on WT's
`Pane::HidePane`/`RestorePane`). Helper + conpty + ACP session + chat
history all survive the toggle. The pane is only destroyed on tab close
or `Ctrl+C×2` in the TUI. See spec §8.

## Autofix

Detects command failures in other panes and auto-suggests fixes via the agent.

**Pipeline**: Shell emits `OSC 133;D;<exit_code>` → `TerminalPage` raises `ProtocolVtSequenceReceived` → COM server forwards to clients → WTA (via `wtcli listen --json`) classifies → `maybe_trigger_autofix()`.

**Requirements**: PowerShell shell integration (OSC 133 marks), a helper
whose ACP session has reached `Connected`, `wtcli` on PATH. The pane does
**not** need to be visible — the per-tab pre-warmed helper (see
Architecture) makes autofix work on a stashed pane. But a failure that
lands before the helper's session connects (cold start of master/agent
CLI, in-flight `session/new`, or a `Failed` agent) is **dropped**:
`trigger_autofix_inner` early-returns when `state != Connected`
(`app.rs:6820`). The bottom-bar notification banner still shows; only the
autofix pill / LLM call is skipped, and the failure is not re-triggered
once the session later connects.

**Key code**: `tools/wta/src/app.rs` (`classify_wt_event`, `maybe_trigger_autofix`), `TerminalPage.cpp:2650-2740` (event handlers), `TerminalProtocolComServer.cpp` (`_ensurePageEventsRegistered`).

**Diag log**: `wta-ensure-host.log` in the WTA log directory — shows event flow, classification, and autofix triggers.

## Hooks plugin auto-upgrade

When IT is installed or upgraded, the bundled `wt-agent-hooks` plugin
(`tools/wta/wt-agent-hooks/{copilot,claude,gemini-extension}/`) needs to
re-land into any agent CLI the user already opted into (via Settings UI /
FRE "Install hooks" or `wta hooks install`). This is handled silently by
`agent_hooks_installer::upgrade_installed_hooks`, fired once per
`wta-master` startup on a blocking-pool thread.

**Trigger model — bundle version is the upgrade signal.** A tiny state
file `<LocalCache>/IntelligentTerminal/hooks-upgrade-state.json` records
the bundle version this wta process last saw per CLI. At startup we read
each CLI's bundle `plugin.json` / `gemini-extension.json` (cheap, <5ms)
and compare; if all match, we return immediately (no spawns, no IO
beyond the cache compare). Only after the user installs / upgrades IT
does the bundle version change → cache miss → per-CLI flow runs once,
then the state file is rewritten and the fast path resumes.

**Opt-in only.** Even on cache miss, CLIs that don't already have
`wt-agent-hooks` installed are skipped. The auto-upgrade never installs
into a CLI the user hasn't accepted. Disabled plugins are also skipped
(`enabled: false` in Copilot's `config.json` / `claude plugin list`).

**Per-CLI strategy.** Copilot and Claude use their `plugin update`
subcommands; before invoking them we rewrite any stale marketplace
`source.path` to the current bundle dir (Copilot: existing
`cleanup_stale_copilot_marketplace`; Claude: new
`cleanup_stale_claude_marketplace`). Gemini's `extensions update`
silently returns `NOT_UPDATABLE` when the recorded install source no
longer exists (typical after an MSIX version-dir bump), so we peek at
`~/.gemini/extensions/wt-agent-hooks/.gemini-extension-install.json`
first: if `type==local` AND `source` is still under the current bundle,
run `extensions update` in place; otherwise fall back to
uninstall+install while preserving the `isActive` flag.

**Trigger-point caveat.** The agent CLI master spawns concurrently may
already be past its plugin-load step by the time `plugin update` writes
the new files — so the freshly upgraded hooks may not take effect until
the next agent restart. Acceptable because blocking master startup on a
Node-based `plugin update` (1-30s) would hurt every IT-upgrade boot.

**Diag**: `wta-install-hooks.log` (existing) plus `target=agent_hooks`
+ `target={copilot,gemini}_hooks` trace events in
`wta-main_master.log` show every per-CLI decision (`upgrade decision`
log line carries `installed_version`, `bundle_version`, `action`).

## Logs & runtime data layout

WTA runtime data lives under the **package-private** store, split by lifetime
into two roots (both resolved in `runtime_paths.rs`, both falling back to the
same bare path when the process has no package identity):

```
# Packaged (every production wta process — helper is a conpty child of the
# packaged WindowsTerminal.exe, master is spawned in-package by SharedWta):

  …\Packages\<PackageFamilyName>\LocalState\IntelligentTerminal\   <- STATE root
      prompts\                      (prompt overrides)             intelligent_terminal_root()
      agent-pane-sessions.jsonl     (session origin index)
      master-pipe.txt               (helper↔master rendezvous)

  …\Packages\<PackageFamilyName>\LocalCache\Local\IntelligentTerminal\  <- LOCAL/cache root
      logs\<pkgver>\                (ALL logs for that build — Rust wta-*.log,
                                     C++ terminal-agent-pane.log, PS hook-trace.log)
      hook-bundle-staging\ …        (hook-installer staging)
      hooks-upgrade-state.json      (per-CLI bundle version cache for the
                                     hooks auto-upgrade fast-path)

# Unpackaged (dev builds run straight out of the Cargo target dir, tests):
# BOTH roots collapse to the legacy bare %LOCALAPPDATA%\IntelligentTerminal\.
```

Rationale for the split: **State** = persistent, must-survive, package-private
data → `LocalState` (alongside the WT app's own `settings.json` / `state.json`).
**Local/cache** = transient, regenerable diagnostics → `LocalCache\Local`, the
cache store that doesn't roam / back up.

Both roots are package-private — removed on uninstall and isolated between the
dev-sideload family (`IntelligentTerminal_rd9vj3e6a2mbr`) and the store family
(`Microsoft.IntelligentTerminal_8wekyb3d8bbwe`) — instead of sharing one bare
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\IntelligentTerminal` directory. The family name comes from
`GetCurrentPackageFamilyName` (windows-sys); the `Packages\<pfn>\LocalState` and
`…\LocalCache\Local` paths are what WinRT `ApplicationData.Current.LocalFolder`
/ `LocalCacheFolder` resolve to, so we construct them directly rather than
pulling in the WinRT projection.

**All three writers share one per-version dir** `logs\<pkgver>\`, where
`<pkgver>` is the **package version** (`GetCurrentPackageId`, e.g. `0.8.0.2`) —
read identically at runtime by Rust (`logging::package_version`) and C++
(`IntelligentTerminal::PackageVersionDir`), so no build-time version sync is
needed:
- Rust wta processes → `logging::log_dir()` (`logs\<pkgver>\wta-*.log`).
- C++ `AgentPaneLog.h` → `IntelligentTerminal::LogDirVersioned()` →
  `terminal-agent-pane.log` (renamed from the old `wta-agent-pane.log`).
- PowerShell hooks (`send-event.ps1`) → `hook-trace.log`, via the
  `WTA_HOOK_LOG_DIR` env var set to `LogDirVersioned()` (C++ ConptyConnection
  for shell panes; `spawn.rs` for agent-pane CLIs).

`IntelligentTerminal::LogDir()` stays the **root** (`…\logs`, no version) and is
used only by the bug-report-zip action so it archives every version at once.
Unpackaged (dev-from-cargo / tests) has no package identity → all writers fall
back to the flat bare `…\logs\`.

> Earlier builds wrote everything to the bare `%LOCALAPPDATA%\IntelligentTerminal`
> regardless of identity (the `LOCALAPPDATA` env var is **not** redirected into
> the sandbox on Win10/11). There is no migration — old data is left in place
> and simply ignored.

**Log level** is controlled by the `WTA_LOG` (or `RUST_LOG`) env var. When
unset, the default comes from the build: **debug builds default to `debug`,
release builds default to `info`** (`logging::default_filter_directive`). Set
`WTA_LOG=debug|trace` for the noisy traces, or `WTA_LOG=warn` to quiet a
release build further.

**Logging is initialized once** in `main()` immediately after arg parsing
(`logging::init(&process_label(&cli))`), before locale/ETW setup, so even
early-startup failures land on disk. The non-blocking appender's `WorkerGuard`
lives in a global and is flushed via `logging::shutdown_flush()` on every exit
path — including before each `std::process::exit` (which would otherwise skip
the guard drop and lose buffered records). Every launch mode — including
short-lived `wtcli`-style commands — now writes a log file (previously only 6
entry points did).

**Per-version storage + retention** (`logging::housekeeping`): each build's
logs live in their own subdir, `logs\<pkgver>\` (the package version — see
above). On every start, `prune_old_version_dirs` keeps **only the current
version's dir** and deletes all other version dirs wholesale. The current
version's dir is never a deletion target, so cleanup is **lock-free and
concurrency-safe** (no process can delete a file another is writing). Within the
current version's dir, per-PID helper logs older than **3 days** are pruned and
`wta-cli.log` rotates daily keeping 3 days (`max_log_files`).

### Log files in the helper+master architecture

```
wta-main_master.log        — wta-master process: agent CLI spawn, named pipe accept
                              loop, per-helper routing, session_to_helper map updates,
                              agent CLI exit detection, connection failures
wta-main_helper-{pid}.log  — each wta-helper process (one file per PID, so concurrent
                              per-tab helpers don't interleave): pipe connect, ACP
                              initialize, session/new, prompts, agent responses,
                              TUI lifecycle, connection failures
wta-cli.log                — short-lived wtcli-style commands (list-*, capture-pane,
                              listen, sessions, …); daily-rotated, 3-day retention
wta-delegate.log           — `?<prompt>` delegation flow (separate from agent pane)
wta-probe.log              — `probe-models` ACP model-list probe
wta-install-hooks.log      — `hooks install` agent-hook bridge installation
wta-ensure-host.log        — WT-side background ensure-running diagnostics (kept from
                              M3-M6 era; remains useful for SharedWta lifecycle)
wta-acp-debug.log          — low-level ACP JSON-RPC wire trace
```

Two files in the per-version dir are **not** written by the Rust wta binary —
`hook-trace.log` (PowerShell hooks) and `terminal-agent-pane.log` (C++ side);
see **All three writers share one per-version dir** above. They live in the
same `logs\<pkgver>\` and so are cleaned together with the Rust logs when that
version's dir ages out.

### Tracking flows by `target` field

All tracing uses structured `target` + key=value fields. Grep patterns for common
scenarios:

| Goal | Grep |
|---|---|
| Master process lifecycle | `target=master` (in `wta-main_master.log`) |
| Who's connected to master right now | `live_helpers=` in `wta-main_master.log` (climbs on connect, drops on disconnect) |
| Which helper owns a SessionId | `step="helper→agent" op="new_session" session_id=…` |
| Trace one prompt end-to-end | grep `session_id="X"`, look for `step="helper→agent" op="prompt"` (sent) then `step="master→helper" op="session_notification"` (response chunks) |
| Helper pipe lifecycle | `target=master helper_id=…` shows connect+exit |
| Agent CLI failures | `target=agent_stderr` |
| Connection failures (either side) | `"exiting with error"` — `target=master` in `wta-main_master.log`, `target=helper` in `wta-main_helper-{pid}.log`; plus inline `step="acp_initialize"` / `step="pipe_connect"` for the helper handshake |
| Internal control routing | `target=internal_control` (legacy; mostly empty post-Z) |

### Example: end-to-end trace of one user prompt

```
[helper] target=acp_client                — pipe connected to master

[helper] target=acp_client                — session/new → session_id=abc-123
[master] step=helper→agent op=new_session — registered abc-123 → helper_id=2

```

If any step is missing, the failure is at the previous step.

## Build

There are two independent build systems. **Both must be built** before F5.

### 1. WTA (Rust) — build first

```bash
# Kill stale WTA processes first
taskkill //f //im wta.exe 2>/dev/null; true

cargo build --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc --manifest-path tools/wta/Cargo.toml
# Output: tools/wta/target/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/debug/wta.exe
#
# Always pass --target explicitly — the wapproj prefers
# tools/wta/target/<triple>/<profile>/wta.exe over the bare target/<profile>
# fallback, and a stale explicit-target binary will silently shadow your
# fresh bare-target build.
```

### 2. Terminal (C++ / MSBuild)

**Command line (incremental):**
```bash
cmd.exe //c "tools\razzle.cmd && bcz no_clean"
# Release: bcz rel no_clean
# Output: bin/x64/Debug/
```

**Visual Studio F5 (debug):**
- Set `CascadiaPackage` as startup project → F5
- MSBuild copies `wta.exe` from Cargo output into the package layout
  (via Content items in `CascadiaPackage.wapproj`)
- The deployed `wta.exe` sits next to `WindowsTerminal.exe` in the
  package directory, inheriting package identity for COM access

### Safe Debug deployment

After a Debug Terminal build, use this wrapper to deploy C++, XAML, IDL,
`wtcli`, manifest, resource, packaging, or mixed changes:

```powershell
.\build\scripts\Invoke-IntelligentTerminalDebugDeployment.ps1 `
    -AppxRecipePath src\cascadia\CascadiaPackage\bin\x64\Debug\CascadiaPackage.build.appxrecipe
```

The script validates the dev package and loose Debug layout, closes only exact
PIDs running from that layout, deploys it, and reopens Intelligent Terminal if
needed. It terminates IT panes and agent sessions but never ordinary Windows
Terminal. Never stop `WindowsTerminal.exe` by name; use `-WhatIf -Verbose` when
process selection is uncertain.

Do not use full deployment for `wta.exe`-only changes; use the WTA hot-refresh
flow. Static assets such as `wt-agent-hooks` are not `wta.exe`-only changes.

### Full rebuild flow (typical dev cycle)

```bash
# 1. Build WTA (always use --target — see note above)
taskkill //f //im wta.exe 2>/dev/null; true
cargo build --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc --manifest-path tools/wta/Cargo.toml

# 2. Build & run Terminal from VS
#    F5 in Visual Studio (CascadiaPackage project)
#    — or from command line:
cmd.exe //c "tools\razzle.cmd && bcz no_clean"
```

### Package identity & COM

The COM server (`TerminalProtocolComServer`) is registered under the
Terminal's package identity. `wtcli.exe` and `wta.exe` must also have
package identity to activate it via `CoCreateInstance`. This is why:

- `wta.exe` is deployed **inside the package** (next to `WindowsTerminal.exe`)
- `_DetectWtaPath()` prefers the co-located `wta.exe` over dev-build paths
- Running `wta.exe` from `tools/wta/target/debug/` directly will fail with
  `0x80073D54` (APPMODEL_ERROR_NO_PACKAGE) when calling COM methods

If autofix or the agent pane stops working after a debug launch, check
`%TEMP%\wta-ensure-host.log` for the `0x80073D54` error — it means
the wrong (unpackaged) `wta.exe` was used.

## Installer

See **[doc/building-installer.md](doc/building-installer.md)** for full details.

Two distribution formats:

| Format | Script | Output |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **MSIX ZIP** (packaged) | Manual assembly from MSBuild output | `artifacts/local-installer/*-msix.zip` |
| **Self-extracting EXE** (unpackaged) | `build/scripts/New-WtaLocalInstaller.ps1` | `artifacts/local-installer/*-setup.exe` |
